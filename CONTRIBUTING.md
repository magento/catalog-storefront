# Contributing to Catalog Storefront

Contributions to the Magento 2 codebase are done using the fork & pull model.
This contribution model has contributors maintaining their own fork of the Magento 2 repository.
The forked repository is then used to submit a request to the base repository to “pull” a set of changes.
For more information on pull requests please refer to [GitHub Help](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/).

Contributions can take the form of new components or features, changes to existing features, tests, documentation (such as developer guides, user guides, examples, or specifications), bug fixes or optimizations.

The Magento 2 development team or community maintainers will review all issues and contributions submitted by the community of developers in the first in, first out order.
During the review we might require clarifications from the contributor.
If there is no response from the contributor within two weeks, the pull request will be closed.

For more detailed information on contribution please read our [beginners guide](https://github.com/magento/magento2/wiki/Getting-Started).

## Contribution requirements

1. Pull requests (PRs) must be accompanied by a meaningful description of their purpose. Comprehensive descriptions increase the chances of a pull request being merged quickly and without additional clarification requests.
2. Commits must be accompanied by meaningful commit messages. Please see the [Magento Pull Request Template](https://github.com/magento/magento2/blob/2.3-develop/.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md) for more information.
3. PRs which include new logic or new features must be submitted along with:
* Scenarios that describe how new functionality will be used by clients
* Proposed [documentation](https://devdocs.magento.com) updates. Documentation contributions can be submitted via the [devdocs GitHub](https://github.com/magento/devdocs).
4. Sign [Magento's CLA](https://magento.com/legaldocuments/mca), which is here
