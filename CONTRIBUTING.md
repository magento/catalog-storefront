# Contributing to Magento 2 code

Contributions to this codebase are done using the fork & pull model.
This contribution model has contributors maintaining their own copy of the forked codebase (which can easily be synced with the main copy). The forked repository is then used to submit a request to the base repository to “pull” a set of changes. For more information on pull requests please refer to [GitHub Help](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/).

Contributions can take the form of new components or features, changes to existing features, tests, documentation (such as developer guides, user guides, examples, or specifications), bug fixes or optimizations.

The Community Engineering team will review all issues and contributions submitted by the community of developers in the first in, first out order. During the review we might require clarifications from the contributor. If there is no response from the contributor within two weeks, the pull request will be closed.

## Contribution process

If you are a new GitHub user, we recommend that you create your own [free github account](https://github.com/signup/free). This will allow you to collaborate with the Magento 2 development team, fork the Magento 2 project and send pull requests.

1. Search current listed issues (open or closed) for similar proposals of intended contribution before starting work on a new contribution.
2. Review and sign the [Contributor License Agreement (CLA)](https://opensource.adobe.com/cla.html) if this is your first time contributing. You only need to sign the CLA once.
3. Create and test your work.
